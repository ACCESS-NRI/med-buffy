Available Responders
====================

Buffy listens to events in the target repo using responders. Every responder is a subclass of the `Responder` class.
Each responder have a `define_listening` method where the action and/or regex the responder is listening to are defined.
The actions a responder takes if called are defined in the `process_message` method.

Buffy includes a list of Responders that can be used by configuring them in the YAML settings file.
