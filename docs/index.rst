Buffy
=====
A service to provide a bot helping scientific journals manage submission reviews.

Buffy automates common editorial tasks like those needed by the `Journal of Open Source Software <http://joss.theoj.org/>`_ or `rOpenSci <https://ropensci.org/>`_.

Buffy provides a bot that interacts during the peer-review process with editors, reviewers and authors to help them perform actions on the review, the software being reviewed and its corresponding paper.
